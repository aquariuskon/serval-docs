Linux.conf.au 2013 slides
=========================
[Serval Project][], January 2013

These diagrams were prepared for presentations made by the [Serval Project][]
at [Linux.conf.au][] 2013 held in Canberra at the end of January.

 * The originals in the [dia](./dia) directory were created by Andrew Bettison
   using the free [Dia][] diagram editor.

 * The [png](./png) directory contains the diagrams converted into [PNG][]
   format (width 1280 pixels) using the [dia-to-png.sh](./dia-to-png.sh) script.
   These are suitable for inclusion in documents and web pages, and are intended
   to be statically linked as image resources from within documents using stable
   URLs like
   https://raw.github.com/servalproject/serval-docs/master/linux.conf.au-2013/slides/png/Protocol%201%20-%20MDP%20packet.png
   Do not rename or move these files to another directory.

 * The [svg](./svg) directory contains the slides converted into [SVG][] format
   using the [dia-to-svg.sh](./dia-to-avg.sh) script.  These are suitable for
   inclusion in documents that support SVG.

If you wish to modify these diagrams, please copy them to another directory
(not within **linux.conf.au-2013**) and edit the copy, so that documents which
embed these diagrams do not get broken.
