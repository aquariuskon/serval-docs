Linux.conf.au 2013 slides
=========================
[Serval Project][], January 2013

These diagrams were prepared for presentations made by Serval Project at
Linux.conf.au 2013 held in Canberra at the end of January.

* The originals in the [dia](./dia) directory were created by Andrew Bettison
  using the free [Dia][] diagram editor.

* The [svg](./svg) directory contains the slides converted into [SVG][] format
  using the [dia-to-svg.sh](./dia-to-svg.sh) script.  These are suitable for
  inclusion in documents and web pages, and are intended to be statically
  linked from within documents using stable URLs like
  http://github.com/servalproject/serval-docs/linux.conf.au-2013/slides/svg/Protocol%201%20-%20MDP%20packet.svg
  so do not rename or move these files to another directory.

* The [png](./png) directory contains the slides converted into [PNG][] format
  using the [dia-to-png.sh](./dia-to-png.sh) script.  These are suitable for
  for inclusion in documents and web pages that do not support SVG.

If you wish to modify these diagrams, please copy them to another directory
(not within **linux.conf.au-2013**, and edit the copy, so that documents which
embed these diagrams do not get broken.
