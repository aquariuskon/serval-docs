**What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?**
The Application obtains the information you provide when you download and configure the Application. The information (chosen phone number and name) is stored only on the device. However, when using a Serval Mesh network, devices will use that information to identify you, as other instances of our software may retrieve the user provided information as part of normal operations. A unique SID (Serval Identifier) is generated on configuration to assist in identifying the Serval Mesh instance. 
**Other third parties do not see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application.**
**We do not perform any automatic Data Collection and Advertising.**
**Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information**
User provided data remains on the device until the user removes it.  Anything shared by the user on the network will remain available to the network. 
**Children**
We do not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13. 
**Security**
We use Elliptic Curve Cryptography, which means messages and calls can only be opened by the device that has the right SID. Ensuring the physical security of the device remains the responsibility of the user.
**Changes**
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Serval Developer Wiki: http://developer.servalproject.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=content:process:servalmesh:privacypolicy . You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.
**Your Consent**
By using the Services, you are consenting to our processing of User Provided and Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us.
